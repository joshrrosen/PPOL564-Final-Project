# The Problem

## problem 1: History

- What is happening
- Why now (despite seeming decrease)

## Problem 2 slide

- What this paper is about

## Problem 3

# Methods/Approaches Considered 

## M/A C: 1

- Considered aggregating local data (most cities have their own systems)
- Considered New Zealand's data (pretty extensive), but wanted to focus on US (distinct laws, infrastructure/planning, car culture that likely contribute to the problem)

# Methods/Tools Used: 1 (data)

- NHTSA FARS 
- Data goes back to 1975
- Primary analysis will be on 2019 data
- Every variable imaginable (# of passangers, weather, light, road, car, ETC!)

## Methods/tools used: 2 (Viz)

- Viz (show some Viz)
- Used to explore priors. It's way more interesting if we counter some (like urban vs. rural), but mostly it's what we'd expect (more on this in final slide)

## Methods/tools used: 3 (models)

- Classification
- want to know what combination of events helps us to predict that an injury type will be a fatality
- Models:
  - Naive Bayes
  - KNN
  - Decision Tree
  - Random forest
  - Logit
  - Gradient Boosting
  - SVM
- Last two haven't run (it takes too long)

# Preliminary Results: 1 (model output)

- Current best model / parameters:
- current best score:
- current ROC_AUC_Score:
- Current Accuracy_Score: (idc abt this silly metric)

## Prelim Results: 2 (model interpretation)

- Show the tree plot
- talk about how it's difficult to interpret with the dummy issue

## Prelim Results: 2 (continued)

- consider showing other interpretting plots (if will run)

## Prelim Results: 3 (conclusion)

- This is a highly predictive model that tells us essentially nothing interesting

# Lessons Learned (so far)

- bayes rate fallacy makes Viz pretty tough (show some)
